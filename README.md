# Python

A project for learning the basics of **Python** programming language. My purpose is to learn best practices for writing—in theory—production-grade **Python** that is clean, efficient, and maintainable.

## Software Installation and Setup

First I need to set up the environment where I'll be writing **Python** codes and programs. Many people on **Reddit** suggest **Visual Studio Code**/**VS Code**, and it should do fine for simple programs at this stage. My antique desktop PC is still running **Windows 7** so I'll need a legacy **VS Code** version that supports it. A quick **Google** search reveals that **version 1.70** is what I'm looking for.

I go to https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_70 and download the **x64** version. I go through the installation, use the default settings, after which **VS Code** launches.

**ChatGPT** says I should install **Python extension for Visual Studio Code**, so I select the **Extensions** icon on the left sidebar in **VS Code**, write **Python** on the search bar, and select **Install Release Version**.

After the installation is complete, I click **Create Python File** and save the file as **Hello_World.py**.

At this point I need to actually install **Python** on my computer, so I go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/, find version **3.8.6** (the latest compatible version with **Windows 7**), and download **Windows x86 executable installer**.

After downloading, I right-click on **python-3.8.6.exe**, select **Run as administrator**, unselect **Install launcher for all users (recommended)**, and click **Install Now**. I check that **Python** has been installed by opening **cmd.exe**/**Windows Command Prompt** and entering command ```py --version```. The terminal outputs ```Python 3.8.6```, so we're good to go.
