## Software Installation and Setup

First I need to set up the environment where I'll be writing Python codes and programs. Many people on Reddit suggest **Visual Studio Code**/**VS Code**, and it should do fine for simple programs at this stage. My antique desktop PC is still running Windows 7 so I'll need a legacy **VS Code** version that supports it. A quick Google search reveals that **version 1.70** is what I'm looking for.

I go to https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_70 and download the **x64** version. I go through the installation, use the default settings, after which **VS Code** launches.
